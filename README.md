# profile-bootstrap

## Description

In this project I created 3 pages for a personal portfolio using html, CSS and Bootstrap. 
The project utilizes responsive mobile first design, using semantic html and accessiblity. 

Page1- The Profile page contains a thumnail image and some text wrapping around the image. 

Page2- The Portfolio page contains 5 images with title banners layered on top and acting as a link when clicked.

Page3- The Contact page contains a form including boxes for name, email and message. This includes a submit button. 

## Common design elements on each page

A responsive navbar with a brand name and 3 navigation menu items including About, Portfolio and Contact. 

A sticky footer which includes a centered copyright symbol. 

## Navbar features

The responsive navbar spilts into 2 rows under 768px and the text becomes centered. 
Above 768px the brand is aligned left and the menu items aligned right in one row. The menu items display black when activate. 

## Body Design

Pages are broken down within containers into rows and columns to work with Bootstraps 12-part column system. 
The columns are then made responsive for multiple viewpoints. 
The background colour has been set to a light grey shade for contrast in order to highlight the responsive container. 
Links are currently storing "#" placeholders.
